                        Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither was virtual reality (VR). In this short period of its development, it has delivered so much. But the question is, what is it that humanity will be dealing with by the end of this century? We have prepared a real treat for you as this blog post is a timeline of predictions for the development of VR that lies ahead. Get comfortable as we take a trip into the virtual reality of this decade.
                        Virtual reality as we know it today
                        By now, VR has brought us many fantastic experiences. We use it in retail, healthcare, education, entertainment, architecture, tourism, real estate and many more industries. The list is rather long, but the most important element are the numbers. By now, there are 171 million VR users worldwide, with a tendency towards rapid growth. Today, we face stand-alone headsets, immersive experiences, realistic graphics, and interactivity. Our characters are a part of a unique world known as the Metaverse, where we interact with communities, build our own real estate and invest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a new type of cryptocurrency. It sounds fantastic, but in only eight years from now, things are predicted to take off even more dramatically. Future Business Tech has delivered pretty some great insight into the future – the one that inspired us to create this blog post for you</p>

                    <p class="animate-text">2050 is photorealistic and exciting
                        Just when we thought the VR experience couldn’t get any better, we look set to be experiencing 2050’s VR using 16K headsets, which is 16 times better than what we use today. Photorealistic VR experiences will become even more lifelike, and it will be almost impossible to tell them apart from reality. The forests will be rendered with sub-millimetre precision so that you will be able to see drops of water, damage on the leaves, and many other unique features. The brain-computer interfaces we’ve mentioned in the previous paragraph will become even more advanced, and by 2050, all VR headsets will incorporate this feature.
                        VR experiences will use brain signals to control objects and communicate with other VR users in various experiences, which is particularly interesting in relation to the VR training of the future and advanced VR games.”You can easily manipulate any object in a game using your brain signals,” explains Future Business Tech. The release of Unreal Engine 8 will open an entirely new door for VR creators, as virtual worlds will be significantly bigger and more detailed than those from 2030. Neural data collected from brain-computer interfaces will enable the creation of realistic characters with an infinite number of characteristics. Considering Metahuman, developed in 2020, is already pretty realistic, this will be the next level. Nevertheless, there will still be room for improvement, as the motion of our avatars isn’t predicted to be 100% fluid by this decade</p>

                    <p class="animate-text">2100 will be as futuristic as it gets
                        As we move further towards 2100, which, from today’s standpoint, looks pretty much futuristic, to fully understand the potential of what humanity will face, we suggest you keep an open mind. Regarding VR of the future, the end of this century will be extremely photorealistic as just about every VR experience is predicted to have photorealistic graphics. All of this will be due to the high level of human intelligence we will have acquired by then.    
                        Hardware will become more powerful, and its size will shrink even further, so supercomputers the size of an average laptop today are actually going to be a thing. Because of this level of graphics, it will be hard for some to set the virtual world and real world apart. Immersion will reach its peak thanks to a vast number of nanobots, which will be a regular feature by 2100. These nanobots are described as particles with limited functionality, meaning they won’t affect the human body at all. Nanobots will replace VR headsets and any kind of hardware, thus creating a VR experience that’s almost impossible to tell apart from reality.</p>
